# Python-Keylogger

Keylogger: It  is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke on a specific computer.
Keyloggers are of two types: Hardware Keylogger and Software Keylogger.

## About this Keylogger
This is a software based keylogger which stores all the keystrokes locally in a text file named `keylogger.txt`, with proper timings mentioned.
The attacker needs to run the  `script.vbs` file which will trigger both, `.py` and `.bat` file to run the keylogger.
It will then run keylogger in the background without the knowledge of the target.

Now if you want the keylogger to run everytime the target opens the computer, then you need to follow the given steps:

• Open `Run` by clicking `win + R` keys.

• Type `shell:startup`, press enter

• It will open the startup folder. Now paste the `shortcut` of `script.vbs` file here.

## What can it do?
In this version of `Python-Keylogger` it just records the keystrokes and saves it locally.

### Future Plans
But I've a plan of updating this Keylogger, which will do the following things:

• Record keystrokes and send it via mail

• Take screenshot

• Record mic

• Encrypt and obfuscate the log file

• Capture all the saved emails & passwords

• Make it an executable `.exe` file
